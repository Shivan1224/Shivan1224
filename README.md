## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Shivan1224/Shivan1224** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- This repository contains a classic Snake Game built using Python and generated entirely by the Grok-3 AI model
- I tested the code in Jupyter Notebook, and it worked flawlessly! 
- To run the game, simply clone the repository, navigate to the folder, and execute python snake_game.py
- currently exploring AI-powered game development and looking to optimize game mechanics, enhance AI-generated code, and add new features.
- Feel free to fork, modify, or improve the projectâ€”PRs are always welcome! Connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub for more AI-driven projects. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: This game was built from a single AI-generated promptâ€”no manual coding needed! ğŸ¤–âœ¨
